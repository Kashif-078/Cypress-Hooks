# Cypress-Hooks
Cypress Hooks provide a way to execute code at specific points during the test run, such as before or after a test suite, before or after each individual test, or even before or after specific test cases.

This code snippet demonstrates the usage of Cypress hooks and context blocks for test setup and organization in a test suite. The hooks are utilized to execute code at specific points during the test run, while the context block is used to group related tests together.

The before hook runs once before all the tests in the suite, allowing you to perform any necessary setup tasks or environment configuration. The beforeEach hook runs before each individual test, enabling you to set up the initial state or perform specific actions required for each test case.

Similarly, the afterEach hook runs after each individual test, providing an opportunity to clean up resources or perform any necessary teardown tasks specific to each test. The after hook runs once after all the tests in the suite have completed, allowing you to perform final cleanup or teardown actions.

The code also demonstrates the use of the context block to group related tests together. In this example, two tests, namely "Test 1" and "Test 2," are grouped under the context block. This grouping helps in organizing and structuring the test suite, making it easier to understand and maintain.

By leveraging these Cypress features, developers can ensure proper setup and teardown of test environments, improve test organization, and enhance the reliability and maintainability of their test suites.

Please note that this code snippet is just an example, and you can customize it according to your specific testing requirements.
